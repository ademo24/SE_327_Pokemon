CHANGELOG:
4/25: No spec out today so I started by making it so that the pokemon level up after battles and gain xp, I really wanted this feature in the game so it was the first thing I added.
4/26: I added cash and pokemart functionality to the game and you can use and buy everything switched up the pricing a little for my own convenience.
4/27: made it so that the pokecenter works and switching pokemon works and also madae the type effectiveness works even if I didn't get the types to work perfectly ( I made them random for now)
